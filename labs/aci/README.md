# Lab: Azure Container Instance

This section shows how to extend your AKS Cluster to leverage the power of Azure Container Instance (ACI) and Serverless Containers. Serverless Containers allow you to quickly provision a Container without having to setup any additional infrastructure. It is great for burst capacity scenarios or scenarios where you might only need something to run for a short period of time.
